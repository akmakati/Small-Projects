Showcases the Slot Machine and Parking Meter at TPA done in C.

slot_machine.c - A slot machine that starts with an initial balance entered by
                 the user, then randomly generates 3 numbers per spin. Each spin
                 costs 5 cents and when there is a spin with 3 of the same symbols
                 the user will win 100 cents or $1.
                 
longterm_parking.c - Tampa International Airport offers long-term parking. The
                     first 60 minutes are free; 61-80 minutes is $4; each additional
                     20 minutes is $2; and the max charged is $18 per day (24 hours).
                     This program will calculate the amount due depending on the 
                     user-input of the hours parked and minutes parked.
