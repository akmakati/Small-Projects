We did our code in Python and used one major import which was numpy. If you have any questions, please let us know, thank you!

Instructions to run code:

1. Unzip folder with maze.txt and ProgAssign1 in a folder.
2. Navigate to that folder in command prompt or terminal using "cd 'destination' ".
3. After navigating to folder that contains maze.txt and ProgAssign1, type in terminal/cmd: "python ProgAssign1.py"
4. Code should be running, thanks!
